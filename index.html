<p>Welcome!</p>

I am a Theoretical Physics student at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris.  <br />
On this site you will find more about me and my path through the beautiful subject that is Theoretical Physics.  <br />
I will also share resources which I find particularly interesting, useful and well done along with other various items related to Theoretical Physics. 
 <br />  <br />
Please explore, enjoy and I hope you find something of your interest!
