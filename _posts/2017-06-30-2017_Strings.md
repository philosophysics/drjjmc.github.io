# Talk
Meant for a broad audience, giving a "big picture" overview of a thread running through the amplitudes community. Attempts to gently introduce  color-kinematics, double-copy, geometric picture, generalizations that let us get to 5-loops maximal supergravity, playful constructions like Z-theory, and applications to classical solutions.

**If it were up to me, I might have chosen a *slightly* different freeze-frame for the video ;-)**

# Bonus Mathematica code

Here's the Mathematica code I used to scrape inSPIRES to build a weighted display of authors who cited a particular paper.  Need to have the inSPIRES <code>recid</code> (can read off the url after clicking on the paper).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/drjjmc/fe09d3fd267c5d2a6112af0377da223f.js"></script>

Ugly hack -- might be ameliorated if I could find *any* docs on inSPIRE's API.

--------

Usage:
```
getAuthorsForPaper[635599]// Sort  (* 2003 Witten's Twistor String paper *)
```
