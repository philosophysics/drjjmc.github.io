During the course of my studies I have realized how invaluable a well written set of lecture notes can be. Good lecture notes mean you learn the material well, faster and easier. This doesn't mean however that the notes are easy or that they dumb down the subject, not at all. 
</br>
Here I collect lecture notes and resources which I have found to be valuable (if I have studied from them) or that struck me as well written and which I plan to read at some point. I must recognize I was somewhat inspired by Gerard 't Hooft's website
