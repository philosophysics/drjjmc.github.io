During the course of my studies I have realized how invaluable a well written set of lecture notes can be. Good lecture notes mean you learn the material well, faster and easier. This doesn't mean however that the notes are easy or that they dumb down the subject, not at all. 



Here I collect lecture notes and resources which I have found to be valuable (if I have studied from them) or that struck me as well written and which I plan to read at some point. I must recognize I was somewhat inspired by Gerard 't Hooft's website
<a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html"> How to become a good Theoretical Physicist </a> and I encourage you to visit it. 

I try to divide when possible by subject but, especially for advanced topics, they tend to mix a little. You will also find links to other collections of notes. I will try to follow an order of increasing difficulty, which can be useful to fellow students.

  * David Tong's introductory <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html
"> QFT </a> notes are a great place to start if you haven't encountered QFT yet. A third year student with good knowledge of QM should find them accesible.  A complementary book of roughly the same level is the one by Maggiore with the bonus of quite a few worked examples and solved problems.

  *  <a href="https://zzxianyu.com/notes/">  Solutions </a> to Peskin and Schroeder by Zhong-Zhi Xianyu. Exercises, I believe,  are the backbone of a physicist's education and one should spend at least as much time doing exercises as reading the theory. Solutions to problems are then a great asset if used correctly. Although I haven't studied much from P&S, I have used it for the problems and the combination with these solutions probably make it the best place to study the fundamentals of QFT from.

  * Brando Bellazzini and Stephane Lavignac's QFT II course at ENS was very good. Brando's <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/brandobellazzini/teaching?authuser=0" > website </a> has notes for all of his lectures, exercise sessions and homework problems (with solutions). The notes are handwritten but very readable, the homework is Latexed and so are the solutions. The course's two main topics are non abelian gauge theories and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Brando was often original and did not follow a textbook which makes his notes quite valuable.
