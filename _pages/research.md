During my studies I have had the chance to be involved in some interesting research projects. 

- Currently I am conducting my M2 internship with [Elias Kiritsis](http://hep.physics.uoc.gr/~kiritsis/) and Francesco Nitti on aspects of holographic RG flows for QFTs on curved manifolds. 

- Last year I was a summer student at DAMTP, Cambridge University working with [Cora Uhlemann](https://corauhlemann.webs.com/) on statistics of biased tracers of large scale structure.

- For my M1 internship I worked with Giuseppe Policastro on entanglement entropy and matrix models, in particular the c=1 model.
