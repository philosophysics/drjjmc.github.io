During my studies I have had the chance to be involved in some interesting research projects. 

- Currently I am conducting my M2 internship with [Elias Kiritsis](http://hep.physics.uoc.gr/~kiritsis/) and Francesco Nitti working on holography. In particular I am studying holographic phase transitions and RG flows which generalize the Hawking-Page transition. 

- Last year I was a summer student at DAMTP, Cambridge University. I worked in the [Relativity and Gravitation](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/) group with [Cora Uhlemann](https://corauhlemann.webs.com/) on Cosmology and Large Scale Structure of the universe. In particular we worked on statistics of biased tracers of large scale structure. 

- During my first year at ENS, I worked in the ENS theory group [Fields, Gravity and Strings](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/research/int-fond/champs-gravitation-cordes/?lang=en)  with Giuseppe Policastro. I studied entanglement entropy of matrix models dual to two-dimensional string theory, in particular the //( c=1//) model and the Kazakov-Kutasov-Kostov model and managed to obtain some new results. This project taught me a lot since the topic lies at a crossroads of different areas: quantum information, random matrix theory and its applications, integrability, some condensed matter even and of course the 'little' holographic duality between strings and matrix models.
