## Welcome!
I am a Theoretical Physics student at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris. On this site you will find more about me and my path through the beautiful subject that is Theoretical Physics. I will also share resources which I find particularly interesting, useful and well done along with other various items related to Theoretical Physics. 

Please explore, enjoy and I hope you find something of your interest!
