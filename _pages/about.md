## Short Bio
I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain but my family is italian. I moved to Pisa, Italy for my undergrad, partly because I wanted to experience living in my country of origin.  In 2018 I left behind the beautiful sunsets over the Tuscanian hills and I moved to Paris to pursue my master´s in theoretical physics at École Normale Supérieure. Living at the hsitorical ENS dorms in Rue d'Ulm, right next to the Pantheon, I had an extraordiinary way to experience Paris. I don't know yet where physics and life might take me but surely ending up in Paris is very appealing.
