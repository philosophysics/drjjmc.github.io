Github is a very easy way to create a personal website, there are thousands of repositories with templates. 
The template for this site is the [minimal mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/). I found it when checking out the website of physicist J.J. Carrasco: <a href="prettyquestions.com"> Pretty Questions </a> and I forked it from there. Apparently he also forked it from the site of another physicist, Leo Stein: [Due to Symmetry](http://duetosymmetry.com).
